 Synapse – AI Learning Platform

Synapse is a front-end web application that converts static documents into an interactive learning experience. Users can upload a file, ask questions through an AI-style chat interface, and practice concepts using a built-in quiz system. The project is fully client-side and requires no backend.

Simulated AI responses with a clean, modern messaging layout.
